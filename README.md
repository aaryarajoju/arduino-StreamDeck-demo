# arduino-StreamDeck-demo

## Inspiration
create a highly customizable stream deck alternative using an Arduino

## What it does
can configure up to 10 shortcuts on, shortcuts may include launching apps and/or performing macros

## How I built it
used Arduino to detect button presses and send a serial signal to the computer as to which button is pressed, and then carryout the respective action on the computer using node.js

## Challenges we ran into
using node.js libraries to perform system actions was a comparatively hard task to figure out

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I created something that is highly useful for me

## What we learned
how to use the serial port as a communication between the Arduino and computer

## What's next for Arduino - StreamDeck
added more ease-of-use or more buttons, for a higher number of shortcut options
